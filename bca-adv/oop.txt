Object Oriented Programming:
   - class-logical representation of object
             or
           class is a user defined data type contains variables and methods
   - Object-physical representation of class
           - object is a real time entity
           - object is run time entity
       ex:pen,car,chair etc
   - Encapsulation-binding different data type into a single block
  def: wrapping up of data and functions into a single block called "Encapsulation".
example:  class
   - Inheritance:code reusability
     def:accessing variables and methods from one class to another class without re-declaration

        or
 Aquiring the properties of one class into another class

   - Polymorphism-poly=many
                  morphic=forms


      ex:Method Overloading

   - abstraction:Hiding the backgroud details
        ex: abstract class,interface
